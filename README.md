# tikipedia

### Huh?
A passion project aimed to catalog my favorite riffs on tiki cocktails. Also a chance to play with React and up my FE web skills.

### What's it built in?
- Database: Postgres
- API: GraphQL server + knex
- Website: React + GraphQL
- Infrastructure: docker + docker compose (I recommend using OrbStack for local development)

### Goals
- [X] V1 of home page: mostly-responsive view of recipe cards that can quickly bring up minimalist recipe descriptions - tiki recipes are complicated!
- [X] V1 of admin page: desktop-optimized page for easy, intuitive adminstration of recipes + components
- [ ] Mobile optimzation
- [ ] UI polish and unique character
- [ ] Public deployment + access control for admin page
