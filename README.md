# tikipedia

### Huh?
A passion project aimed to catalog my favorite riffs on tiki cocktails. Also a chance to play with React and up my FE web skills.

### What's it built in?
- Database: Postgres
- API: GraphQL server + knex
- Website: React + GraphQL
- Infrastructure: docker + docker compose (I recommend using OrbStack for local development)
